## Contribution process

If you don't have a specific contribution in mind, feel free to browse the list of existing issues
to find something you would be interested to help with. All issues are open for contribution. If you
are new to the project or would prefer something reasonably ambitious, you can filter to only show
the [good first
issues](https://github.com/google/wasefire/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:"good+first+issue"). Then
simply reply to the issue mentioning your interest and how much mentoring you would like. You may as
well directly open a pull request for that issue if you don't need any mentoring or clarifications.

If you have a specific change ready, feel free to send the pull request for review. If the pull
request is not fixing an existing issue or a typo, describing the motivation for the change would
accelerate the review. And if the pull request is complex to understand, a high-level design in the
description would also help the review.

In all other cases, feel free to open a new issue for discussion. Depending on the type of issue,
the initial comment would describe a specific problem you encountered, the motivation for a change
or feature request you would like, possible design or implementation ideas you have, etc.

You can find more information on how to [open an

request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) in the [GitHub
