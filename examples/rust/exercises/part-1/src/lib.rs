//! This exercise is essentially some "echo" applet on a UART. It writes back to the UART whatever
//! it receives.
//!
//! If you are running the applet on the host runner, you can connect to the UART (from the root
//! directory of the repository) with:
//!
//! ```shell
//! ./scripts/wrapper.sh socat -,cfmakeraw UNIX-CONNECT:target/wasefire/uart0
//! ```

#![no_std]
wasefire::applet!();

fn main() {
    loop {
        // TODO: Read from the UART using serial::read_any().
        // TODO: Debug print what was read with debug!().
        // TODO: Send back to the UART what was read with serial::write_all().
        // TODO: Debug print that the data was sent.
    }
}
