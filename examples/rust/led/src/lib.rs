//! Demonstrates simple LED and button interaction.
//!
//! The board must possess at least one LED and one button. The applet maintains a dynamic mapping
//! from buttons to LEDs so that every button may control any LED over time. Initially, all buttons
//! are associated to the first LED. Each time a button is pressed or released, its associated LED
//! is toggled. After a button is released, it becomes associated with the next LED (wrapping back
//! to the first LED after the last LED).
