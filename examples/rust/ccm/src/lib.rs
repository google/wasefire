//! Demonstrates simple AES-CCM usage.
//!
//! The applet also uses USB serial and RNG. The applet starts listening on the USB serial. A random
//! key and IV are generated before waiting for the next character. If the character is not a digit,
//! it is ignored (but refreshes the key and IV). Digits are mapped to their own value except `0`
//! which is mapped to 10. When a digit is received, a random value of the associated length is
//! created. That value is first encrypted then decrypted.
