We would like to thank all authors and contributors of those projects (as well
as those we use but we forgot to mention) and more generally the community
around Rust for embedded development. We are also grateful to those who answered
our issues [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]] and reviewed our pull
requests [[10], [11], [12], [13]].

[^exhaustiveness]: We tried to focus on the projects that were critical to get
    where we are now. Some projects are thus deliberately left out (and some
    projects that we don't use anymore are still listed). But it is also
    possible that we forgot to list some, in which case we apologize and would
    be happy to fix our oversight if notified.
