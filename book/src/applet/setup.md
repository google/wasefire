# Setup

The list of required dependencies might not be complete. So if anything in the
tutorial doesn't go according to plan, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/google/wasefire/issues/new) describing the problem.

## Clone the project repository

This step will eventually not be needed. Because the project is not yet released
on `crates.io`, the prelude and other dependencies must be available somewhere
on the filesystem.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/wasefire
cd wasefire
```

## Run the setup script

To install all dependencies, run the setup script. If it fails, follow its
instruction and run it again.

```shell
./setup.sh
```
