# Buttons

In this section, we will walk through 2 Rust examples:
- The `button` example illustrates stateless usage but lets us introduce how to
  handle events with callbacks.
- The `led` example illustrates stateful usage and thus how to access state in
  callbacks.

## Stateless usage

This example prints to the debug output the new state of a button each time that
button changed state and so for all buttons.

Similarly to LEDs, there is a `button::count()` function to discover the number
of buttons available on the board:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button1.rs:count}}
```

We want to listen on events for all available buttons, so we loop over all
button indices (starting at 0):

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button1.rs:loop}}
```

For each button, we define a handler that prints the new button state to the
debug output. The handler takes the new button state as argument. Since
`button::State` implements `Debug`, we simply use `{state:?}` to print the new
state.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button1.rs:handler}}
```

We can now start listening for events. This is done by creating a
`button::Listener` which will call the provided handler each time the button
changes state. We specify the button we want to listen to by its index and the
handler as a closure.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button1.rs:listener}}
```

A listener continues to listen for events until it is dropped. Since we want to
indefinitely listen, we must not drop the listener. A simple way to do that is
to leak it. This is equivalent to calling `core::mem::forget()`.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button1.rs:leak}}
```

Finally, we just endlessly wait for callbacks. This step is optional: waiting
for callbacks indefinitely is the implicit behavior when `main` exits. In some
way, `main` can be seen as a callback setup procedure. The
`scheduling::wait_for_callback()` function puts the applet to sleep until a
callback is scheduled and `scheduled::wait_indefinitely()` is just an infinite
loop around `wait_for_callback()`.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button1.rs:wait}}
```

The final code looks like this:

```rust,no_run
{{#include button1.rs:all}}
```

## Testing

The `host` runner currently has 1 button and is controlled by typing `button` on
a line on `stdin`. Eventually, the number of buttons will be configurable and
how they are controlled will be improved (for example through some graphical
interface).

## Stateful usage

This example combines all the LEDs and buttons available on the board by
maintaining a dynamic mapping between them. Initially, all buttons map to the
first LED. Each time a button is pressed or released, the LED it is mapped to is
toggled. And when a button is released, it maps to the next LED (or the first
one if it was mapping to the last one).

In particular:
- A single button can toggle all LEDs.
- Multiple buttons can toggle the same LED.
- A button may stay pressed while another button is pressed.
- All buttons eventually toggle all LEDs.

We skip over the setup which doesn't illustrate anything new:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button2.rs:setup}}
```

Because buttons dynamically map to a LED, we need a state to store this
information. We create this state on the heap because we will eventually leak
the listener and exit the `main` function to indefinitely listen for button
events. This state simply contains the index of the LED to which this buttons
maps to. We have to use `Cell` because the handler is called as `&self` (and
thus closures must be `Fn` not `FnMut`)[^cell].

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button2.rs:state}}
```

When defining the button handler, we must move (and thus transfer ownership of)
the state we just created to the handler, such that the handler can read and
write the state when called.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button2.rs:handler}}
```

When the handler is called, we first toggle the associated LED:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button2.rs:toggle}}
```

And then if the button is released, we update the dynamic mapping to point to
the next LED (wrapping if needed):

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button2.rs:update}}
```

Finally, we create a button listener with the defined handler. And we leak it to
continue listening after it going out of scope and in particular after `main`
returns.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include button2.rs:listener}}
```

The final code looks like this:

```rust,no_run
{{#include button2.rs:all}}
```

[^cell]: This is because the handler could wait for callbacks itself (which the
    prelude has no way to know, or is there?) and thus the handler may be
    reentered. This would essentially copy a mutable reference which is unsound.
