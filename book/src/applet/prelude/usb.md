# USB

For now only USB serial is supported. Eventually, the idea would be for applets
to describe the USB interfaces they need in some init function. The scheduler
would then create the USB device based on those information. And only then start
the applets with capabilities to the interfaces they asked for.

In this section, we will illustrate USB serial usage by walking through the
`memory_game` example. The game is essentially an infinite loop of memory
questions. The player has 3 seconds to memorize a random base32 string (the
length is the current level in the game and thus represents the difficulty). The
player than has 7 seconds to type it back. On success they go to the next level,
otherwise to the previous level.

The applet has only 2 states across loop iterations:
- The level of the game (and thus the length of the string to remember) starting
  at 3.
- The next prompt to show to the player while they get ready for the next
  question.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:state}}
```

Everything else is in the infinite loop:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:loop}}
```

First thing we do is print the prompt and wait for the player to press Enter. We
use ANSI escape codes to overwrite whatever was there before. As an invariant
throughout the game, we always use a single line of the terminal. This is
particularly important to overwrite the question since the player has to guess
it. We write to the USB serial using `serial::write_all()`. This function is
generic over objects implementing `serial::Serial`, in this case
`usb::serial::UsbSerial`.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:prompt}}
```

We then wait until the player press Enter. We can read a single byte from the
USB serial using `serial::read_byte()`. The terminal sends `0x0d` when
Enter is pressed.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:ready}}
```

To generate the next question, we use `rng::fill_bytes()` which fills a buffer
with random bytes. We provide a buffer with the length of the current level. For
the string to be printable we truncate the entropy of each byte from 8 to 5 bits
and convert it to a `base32` symbol.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:generate}}
```

We can now show the question to the player. We do so using a `process` helper
function that we will also use for the answer. We instantiate this function such
that the player has 3 seconds to memorize the question and may hit Enter at any
time to start answering.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:question}}
```

After 3 seconds have elapsed or if the player hit Enter, we read the answer from
the player. We give them 7 seconds to type the answer. We also convert
lower-case letters to upper-case for convenience (it's easier to read upper-case
but easier to type lower-case). We also support backspace which the terminal
sends as `0x7f`. And same as for the question, we let the player exit early with
Enter to avoid waiting until the timeout.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:answer}}
```

Once we have the answer, we check if it matches the question. If it does, we
promote the player to the next level. If it doesn't, we demote the player to the
previous level. However, if there are no previous level because the player is at
level 1, then we let them retry the level to show our support. We use ANSI
escape codes to highlight the result.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:update}}
```

Now that we're done with the main loop, let's look at the `process` helper. It
takes 4 arguments:
- `max_secs: usize`: the maximum display time in seconds.
- `prompt: &str`: the message shown at the beginning of the line.
- `data: &mut String`: the data shown after the prompt, which may be updated
  (see below).
- `update: impl Fn(&mut String, u8) -> bool`: the closure called on each input
  byte possibly updating the data and returning whether processing should end
  immediately without waiting for the maximum display time.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process}}
```

The helper counts the number of elapsed seconds in shared variable `secs` and
updates it using a periodic timer every second.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process_setup}}
```

The helper loops as long as the update function didn't say to stop (tracked by
the `done` variable) and there is still time available.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process_loop}}
```

We update the line in the terminal with the prompt, time left, and current data.
We use ANSI escape codes to highlight the data and help readability.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process_write}}
```

To be able to update the time left in the terminal we must read from the USB
serial asynchronously using `serial::Reader`. We create a reader by providing a
mutable buffer to which the reader will write the received bytes.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process_reader}}
```

We then sleep until a callback is executed using
`scheduling::wait_for_callback()`. This callback may either be the timer firing
the next second or the reader getting input from the USB serial.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process_wait}}
```

We call `Reader::result()` to know how many bytes were read from USB serial and
written to the buffer (or if an error occurred). We then simply iterate over the
received bytes and update the data and early exit status according to the
provided closure. Same as with timers, when a reader is dropped, its callback is
canceled.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include usb.rs:process_read}}
```


The final code looks like this:

```rust,no_run
{{#include usb.rs:all}}
```

You can connect to the USB serial with the following command:

```shell
picocom -q /dev/ttyACM1
```
