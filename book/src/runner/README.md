# Runner user guide

This chapter will describe how you can add support for a board. It is not yet written though and
only provides a link to the API to implement.

There's currently only 2 supported boards:

- `nordic` for nRF52840-dk
- `host` for Linux (not clear if more or less is actually supported)
