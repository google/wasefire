# Features

Features are implemented if their checkbox is checked.

If a feature is not implemented, it doesn't mean it will get implemented.
It means this is a feature that could be implemented if there is a user need.

If a feature is not listed, it doesn't mean it won't get implemented. We may
just not be aware of it, and a user need could justify an implementation.

## Supported boards

A board is supported if it has a Runner.

- [x] Linux (for testing without hardware)
- [x] nRF52840
- [ ] OpenTitan

## Supported applet languages

An applet language is supported if it has a Prelude.

- [x] Rust
- [ ] C

Note that when running multiple applets concurrently on the same platform, those
applets don't need to be written in the same language to inter-operate.

## Developer experience

### For applets

- [x] Development doesn't require hardware (using the Linux board).
- [ ] Testing facilities (probably on any board).
- [ ] Fuzzing facilities (probably on Linux board only).
- [ ] Rich debugger experience (probably on any board).

### For runners

- [ ] Testing facilities (probably a set of test applets).

## Reproducible builds

- [ ] Hermetic development environment for applets.
- [ ] Hermetic development environment for platforms.

## Secure platform upgrades

- [ ] The platform can be upgraded.
- [ ] The platform can be downgraded to the extent permitted by the
      User-configured rollback policy.
- [ ] Platform upgrades are digitally signed and verified.

## Applet sandboxing

- [x] Applets can't tamper with the platform.
- [ ] Applets can't tamper with other applets (this is only missing preemptive
      concurrency).

## Applet capabilities

- [x] Applets declare their permissions (i.e. function imports).
- [ ] Applets declare their capabilities (more dynamic concept of permission).
- [ ] Applets metadata (or manifest) is signed.

## Platform side-channel attack testing and resistance

- [ ] Crypto hardware accelerators are leveraged when available.
   - [x] AES CCM (Bluetooth spec) on nRF52840
- [ ] Otherwise fallback software crypto primitives are provided for main
      algorithms.
- [ ] Both of those implementations are side-channel attack resilient.

## Applet portability

- [x] Applets are portable at binary level (comes from Wasm and APIs).

## Applet multiplexing

- [ ] Multiple applets may be installed at the same time.
- [ ] Multiple applets may run simultaneously (not in early versions).
- [ ] Applets can be installed without running.
- [ ] Applets define in their metadata their running condition (e.g. at boot, at
      USB, at idle, etc).

For now, a single applet is baked at compile-time in the platform.

## Applet management

- [ ] Applets are identified by a stable id, a version, and a digital signature
      (verified by the runtime).
- [ ] Applets may be installed if not already present.
- [ ] Applets may be uninstalled in which case all owned resources are deleted.
- [ ] Applets may be upgraded (preserving resources) but not downgraded
      (probably modulo rollback policy).
- [ ] Installed applets can be listed.

## Certification

- [ ] The runtime can run on certified hardware (FIPS-140-3 and CC).
- [ ] TBD: The runtime might sustain being part of the security target for
      certification.

## Low power

- [x] If the runtime is only waiting on external hardware events, the CPU is
      suspended.
