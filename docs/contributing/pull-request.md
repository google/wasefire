# How to change code?

All changes in this repository should go through a pull request.

## Documentation

A pull request should document why it is needed. This could be either omitted (for typos and other
obvious changes), a link to an issue, or a description in the pull request (for complex changes). In
all cases, the pull request title should be clear and concise.

If a pull request adds or modifies specified code, documentation should be added or updated to make
sure everyone agrees on what the code should do.

See the [documentation page](./documentation.md) for more information.

## Testing

If a pull request adds non-trivial code, tests should be added to make sure it is working as
intended and won't be broken in the future.

See the [testing page](./testing.md) for more information.

## Changelog

If a pull request modifies a published crate, the change should be logged to make sure it will be
documented when released.

See the [changelog page](./changelog.md) for more information.
