# How to document code?

The goal of documentation is to specify what the code should do, for both those using and those
implementing the API. However, there is a trade-off between documentation benefits (specification
clarity) and documentation costs (reading and writing time).

## Guidelines

This repository makes the trade-off between documentation benefits and documentation costs in the
following way:

- All public items (function, module, trait, macro, etc) should be documented[^lints].
- Unsafe items should be documented with a safety section.
- Items with non-trivial usage should be documented with an examples section.
- Functions that may panic (resp. fail) should be documented with a panics (resp. errors) section,
  when the panic (resp. error) condition and meaning is not trivial from context.
- Functions with clear name and signature should not be documented. Names and signatures are part of
  the language, so in addition to reducing reading time, maintenance time is also reduced.
- Unsafe operations should be documented with a safety comment.
- Comments should be used for non-trivial logic where there is no clear API boundary to document it.
- Comments should not be used to repeat what the code does, but instead describe what the code
  should do at a higher abstraction level.

[^lints]: This should ideally be tested using the `rust.missing-docs` lint. See the [tracking
    issue][#565] for lints.
