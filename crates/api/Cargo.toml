# Implements the API with weak symbols to permit custom definitions (only
# relevant in wasm mode).
#
# The applet API functions, like `env_dp`, have a default implementation calling
# into an `env_dispatch` function, which in turn has a default implementation of
# panicking. The `env_dispatch` function takes 3 arguments: the link name, a
# pointer to the parameters, and a pointer to the results.
