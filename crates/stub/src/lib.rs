//! This crate provides stubs for parts of the applet API.
//!
//! By default, when using the applet API with the `native` feature, all calls to the applet API
//! will panic. This crate provides a working implementation for some parts of the API (like the
//! crypto module).
//!
//! Note that this crate doesn't expose anything. To use it, you just need to link it:
//!
//! ```
//! use wasefire_stub as _;
//! ```
